Batter:
200 g all purpose flour (tempura goes perfectly)
1   egg 
Water
Salt + Pepper

You want the batter to be thin but to stick well to the fish, so don't hesitate on adding 
an extra egg.

Fish: Any white one you like will do the job. I like cod

Corn tortillas.

Sauces, pickeled onions, lemon, cilantro, onion. For garnishing.

Magic word: taco
